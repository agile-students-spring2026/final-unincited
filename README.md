# News Bias Comparison App


## Description

The News Bias Comparison App is a mobile web application that analyzes political news articles to identify bias in the language and wording used.

The system evaluates word choice, phrases, and patterns of text content to generate a score of biasedness and range from left-leaning to right-leaning. Analyzed articles are displayed on a chart to visualize different news sources and articles for comparison.

Users can view recently ranked articles and individual rankings to understand a detailed explanation for its result. They can also submit new articles for review and save articles of interest for further analysis. 

The goal of this app is to provide interpretable insights into how language influences perceived political bias.
