# News Bias Comparison App


## Description

The News Bias Comparison App is a mobile web application that analyzes political news articles to identify bias in the language and wording used.

The system evaluates word choice, phrases, and patterns of text content to generate a score of biasedness and range from left-leaning to right-leaning. Analyzed articles are displayed on a chart to visualize different news sources and articles for comparison. 



## Product Vision Statement

The goal of this app is to provide interpretable insights into how language influences perceived political bias.

Users will be able to create an account, submit an article for analysis, view recently ranked articles, see a visual bias chart, and open an article to understand why it received its score. Users will also be able to save articles for later.
